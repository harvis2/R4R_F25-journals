### Rose 
During the FOSS session, what worked for me was firstly about the carpentry site(https://carpentries.org/) where I can sign up for free for workshops and learn about new things. Particularly about workshops that relate to my research. Secondly, I was more aware of the importance of open science and why I need to communicate my research to people to get feedback that will improve my work and consequence, add knowledge to others. Then I also see a balance to the open science from the statement that says:  "As open as possible and as closed as necessary”

### Thorn
I did not really get the alphafold3 explanation  (https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3) and I think it would be challenging to apply it to my research. Moreover, it is mostly used by biologists to predict biomolecular structures. I might need more on this. 

### Bud
The carpentries (https://carpentries.org/) could be potentially applicable in term of looking for good workshops to attend. For instance, biochar (my research interest) is a rapidly growing field that is attracting increasing scientific attention; therefore, more workshops, seminars, and conferences are needed. This is particularly important now that the United States and several European countries are working to develop standards for the material. Consequently, more workshops are expected.

## Research Application
The GitHub platform will be very useful for my research group, especially when we need to collaborate on writing a manuscript. It will also allow us to track changes and access the latest version after each author’s contributions. Finally, NotebookLM (https://notebooklm.google.com/) has been very helpful for me in reviewing multiple papers simultaneously and in extracting the most relevant information from selected papers. A typical example is when I was tasked with developing a procedure for the digestion of soil in order to quantify the number of cations and anions present. Using Notebook LM made my work faster and easier, as it allowed me to compare several methods simultaneously.
