## Rose, Bud, Thorn

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Wednesday 10th, 11pm**

### Rose :During the FOSS session, what worked for me was that I should avoid making my data management plan an afterthought as this will help me to be more organized. I also believe that FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics) principles are indispensable principles that guilds data management practices. Also, I found out that I have being doing data management but not in a professional manner.


### Thorn: For me, the use of metadata was mentioned; however, understanding how its best fits in assessing my project may require additional research on my part


### Bud: I believe the DMPTool could potentially be applicable to my work in the future, as creating data management plans early using its templates can strengthen grant proposals and support long-term preservation, especially now that a data management plan has become a requirement for most funders.

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 15th, 11pm**
>I learned that the Data Management Plan (DMP) Tool is a valuable resource, especially now that many funding bodies require a DMP as partof grant applications. The tool provides structured templates where I can input relevant information, and it generates a downloadable DMP at the end. Although I am not currently applying for funding, understanding how the tool works is useful preparation for future research projects. Exploring the templates helped me identify the main components of a strong DMP, including the types of documentation and important questions that must be addressed. I also noticed that different organizations have specific requirements for their DMPs, which highlights the importance of tailoring each plan to the funderâ€™s expectations.

## Cohort meetup discussion

> [!IMPORTANT]

> **Due Thursday 18th, 11am**
>At the cohort meeting, we discussed how public health researchers manage biases in their results. One main point raised was that comparing multiple samples can be an effective strategy to mitigate bias. We also explored methods for securely storing data. I concluded that adhering to the data storage requirements set by funders or sponsors is often the safest approach. Additionally, we discussed open data kit (ODK), a free and open-source suite of tools that enables organizations to collect, manage, and utilize data in resource-limited settings. Overall, it was a highly engaging and insightful session filled with valuable knowledge sharing.
