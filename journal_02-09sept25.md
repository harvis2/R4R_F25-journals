### Rose :During the FOSS session, what worked for me was that I should avoid making my data management plan an afterthought as this will help me to be more organized. I also believe that FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics) principles are indispensable principles that guilds data management practices. Also, I found out that I have being doing data management but not in a professional manner.


### Thorn: For me, the use of metadata was mentioned; however, understanding how its best fits in assessing my project may require additional research on my part


### Bud: I believe the DMPTool could potentially be applicable to my work in the future, as creating data management plans early using its templates can strengthen grant proposals and support long-term preservation, especially now that a data management plan has become a requirement for most funders.
