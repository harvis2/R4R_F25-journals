### Rose
The use of command-line tools could be very helpful, especially when I am trying to search for a lost file or folder

### Thorn
I think I am a little bit slow in catching up on script writing, but I hope I get better as I practice more.

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 22nd, 11pm**
I feel in my research, I can Python to develop and train neural network models that helped me understand and predict biochar production outcomes. By feeding in experimental data—such as feedstock type, pyrolysis temperature, and residence time, the model should be able  predict biochar yield with reasonable accuracy. Beyond production, I  could also applied Python-based neural networks to assess how biochar  and fertilizers affects soil properties which are critical for evaluating biochar’s role in soil amelioration.

## Cohort meetup discussion

> [!IMPORTANT]

> **Due Thursday 25th, 11am**
> Atour meetings, we engaged in tie and dye activities using various design techniques to explore textile patterning. While working on the designs, we held a reflective discussion on the growing challenges posed by climate change.  Some of the conversations emphasized that while scientific research on climate solutions is advancing, meaningful implementation may remain limited unless supported by enforceable policies and legal frameworks
