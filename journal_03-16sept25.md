### Rose
The use of command-line tools could be very helpful, especially when I am trying to search for a lost file or folder.

### Thorn
I think I am a little bit slow in catching up on script writing, but I hope I get better as I practice more.

### Bud
Learning how to use scripts could be useful for managing files in my research project
