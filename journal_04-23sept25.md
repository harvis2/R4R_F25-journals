### Rose
Understanding how to structure prompts for clarity and specificity was immediately useful. For example, using role-based prompts helped refine my feedback from LLMs. Also knowing that there a site https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard I can check out the best LLMs for a particular task is a good one for me. I think I am now a prompt engineer.

### Thorn
While LLMs are helpful with language, they sometimes struggle with hallucination, Which can be misleading sometimes. Hence, the solution I see to this is that human intelligence must be used along with artificial intelligence. That is the loop thing.

### Bud
Using LLMs to generate preamble,abstract of experimental activities, published journals could streamline documentation and improve traceability and general productivity and more recognitions to details in journals.

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 29th, 11pm**
The tool I learnt about  on thursday are so interesting. for instance, semantic scholar offers targeted access to peer-reviewed papers on my reseach while research rabbit AI visualizes citation networks, helping me trace influential studies and uncover emerging trends in biochar applications. NotebookLM acts as a personalized research assistant, allowing  me to upload papers and notes, then ask contextual questions. PerplexityAI  help me in answering complex queries with cited sources. Finally, locally operated AI tools on my computer ensure privacy and speed for tasks like summarizing articles.  Together, these platforms reduce cognitive load and hence clarity of my scientific communication

## Cohort meetup discussion\

> [!IMPORTANT]

> **Due Thursday 2nd, 11am**
In our cohort meeting, we explored the balance between leveraging AI tools and maintaining critical thinking in research. We acknowledged that while AI can enhance efficiency, however overdependence may lead to brain drain. The discussion emphasized the importance of using AI as a complement and not a total replacement for human reasoning. Several members shared concerns about students bypassing foundational learning by relying too heavily on automated outputs. Ultimately,We agreed that the modern world must learn to coexist with AI while thoughtfully integrating it into various aspects of life, recognizing that it is here to stay. This approach ensures that AI enhances creativity rather than causing intellectual decline or brain drain.
