### Rose
Understanding how to structure prompts for clarity and specificity was immediately useful. For example, using role-based prompts helped refine my feedback from LLMs. Also knowing that there a site https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard I can check out the best LLMs for a particular task is a good one for me. I think I am now a prompt engineer.

### Thorn
While LLMs are helpful with language, they sometimes struggle with hallucination, Which can be misleading sometimes. Hence, the solution I see to this is that human intelligence must be used along with artificial intelligence. That is the loop thing.

### Bud
Using LLMs to generate preamble,abstract of experimental activities, published journals could streamline documentation and improve traceability and general productivity and more recognitions to details in journals.
