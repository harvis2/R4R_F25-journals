### Rose
I think version control using GitHub would allow me to track changes in experimental protocols, technical documentation, and presentation materials, drafts of papers when I am in a collaborative work. So, it can help to track changes after adjustment. It can also serve as a storage center or center repository for our research materials or manuscripts.

### Thorn
The majority of the effort will likely be required from the individual managing the merge process, particularly when multiple contributors edit the same section of a document. I think the solution is to assign sections to each person with no interference. I may be wrong but I am trying to get the whole ideas gradually.

### Bud
This could be particularly useful in my research for co-authoring technical papers or grant proposals, as GitHub enables precise version control and seamless tracking of document revisions
