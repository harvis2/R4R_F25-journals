### Rose
I think version control using GitHub would allow me to track changes in experimental protocols, technical documentation, and presentation materials, drafts of papers when I am in a collaborative work. So, it can help to track changes after adjustment. It can also serve as a storage center or center repository for our research materials or manuscripts.

### Thorn
The majority of the effort will likely be required from the individual managing the merge process, particularly when multiple contributors edit the same section of a document. I think the solution is to assign sections to each person with no interference. I may be wrong but I am trying to get the whole ideas gradually.

### Bud
This could be particularly useful in my research for co-authoring technical papers or grant proposals, as GitHub enables precise version control and seamless tracking of document revisions

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 6th, 11pm**
I learned that faculty and students view AI through different lenses. Students often embrace it for productivity and learning, while faculty emphasize ethical use and academic integrity especially older facualty member who dont want to embrace it. I also observed that trust, transparency, and clear guidelines are important to fostering responsible AI adoption.

## Cohort meetup discussion

> [!IMPORTANT]

> **Due Thursday 9th, 11am**
> In todayâ€™s cohort meeting, we examined the persistent challenges researchers face in navigating the divide between open access publishing and subscription-based journals. We discussed how high publication fees, limited institutional support. Additionally, we reflected on the reluctance of major LLM companies to share their training data, noting that despite the rhetoric around open science, these firms prioritize proprietary control and monetization over transparency and collaboration.
