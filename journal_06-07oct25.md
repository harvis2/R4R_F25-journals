### Rose
Although, I do not currently code in my reseaarch, however I see that the use of reproducible software environments (e.g., Conda) is a good way to manage software with diiferent updates. It is definately something I would make use in the future becuase am currently  getting familiar with the python environs.
### Thorn
While the concept of automation was compelling, it wasnâ€™t entirely clear how to integrate it into my current research workflow. My pyrolytic system operates without connection to a computer. Although bridging the gap between physical instrumentation and programmable automation is not really a question for me now. 

### Bud
In engineering, we commonly use P, PI, and PID controllers to regulate automation processes. Integrating programmable code into these control systems could enhance their operational efficiency, especially when managing software environments for automated workflows
