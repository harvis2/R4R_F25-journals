### Rose
Although, I do not currently code in my reseaarch, however I see that the use of reproducible software environments (e.g., Conda) is a good way to manage software with diiferent updates. It is definately something I would make use in the future becuase am currently  getting familiar with the python environs.
### Thorn
While the concept of automation was compelling, it wasn’t entirely clear how to integrate it into my current research workflow. My pyrolytic system operates without connection to a computer. Although bridging the gap between physical instrumentation and programmable automation is not really a question for me now. 

### Bud
In engineering, we commonly use P, PI, and PID controllers to regulate automation processes. Integrating programmable code into these control systems could enhance their operational efficiency, especially when managing software environments for automated workflows

## Research Application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Due Monday 8th, 11pm**
Like i said earlier engineers often rely on control systems like P, PI, and PID to manage automation tasks. By embedding programmable logic into these systems, I think it is possible to optimize how they interact with digital environments, especially when coordinating complex, software-driven workflows. i think this is where the application could come in(if needed) when it comes to my researcvh

## Cohort meetup discussion

> [!IMPORTANT]

> **Due Thursday 16th, 11am**
Today's discussion explored the ethical and practical dimensions of software use in academia, especially the reliance on cracked tools due to financial constraints and monopolistic pricing, which sparked debate over access versus developer rights. Participants contrasted proprietary models like Stata with open-source alternatives such as R and Python, noting how freemium tools often fail in low-connectivity regions. Reproducibility emerged as a main concern, with Conda highlighted for managing software environments and ensuring stable research outputs. Pedagogical practices were critiqued for favoring familiar proprietary tools over accessible ones, prompting calls for asset-based teaching that values students’ resourcefulness. A generational shift toward open tools was evident, driven by cost, transparency, and community empowerment. The conversation concluded with a wish for integrated platforms and diverse programming fluency to simplify workflows and enhance research resilience
